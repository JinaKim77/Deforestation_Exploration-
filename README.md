### A report document that includes the following sections:
1. GLOBAL SITUATION
2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK
3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL
4. RECOMMENDATIONS
5. APPENDIX: SQL queries used

### Introduction
SQL is most commonly used to manipulate and analyze data to inform decision making. In this project, you will act as a data analyst for an organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this important environmental topic. First, youâ€™ll clean any erroneous values in a table, join that table to another lookup table to bring in a new categorical and quantitative variable, and return a new view of all categories greater than a reference value. Then, you will create and execute SQL queries to perform calculations using variables from those disparate data sets to answer questions for stakeholders. Your analysis will help you better understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area. Lastly, you will compile your answers and summarize your analysis into a report that can be shared with a leadership team.
